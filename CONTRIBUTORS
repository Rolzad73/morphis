Herein is mentioned some of the many who have directly contributed to MORPHiS in ways that aren't reflected in the Git history otherwise.

Melissa Facciolo:
    - The Dmail V2 GUI Design, including the HTML and CSS work. Also enduring the horrible task of IE testing.

Not Jesus:
    - Coming up with the name DDS, Distributed Discussion System.

shunt31:
    - For writing the FAQ!

Florian Paul Schmidt:
    - For being morphis user 001 :)

Some I may have forgot at the moment:

And especially all supporters thus far!
