Version: 0.8.0 - Developer Preview Release

License: GPL v2 for everything except for some files LGPL, and some public domain. See the LICENSE file for complete details.

I have done this, released the asyncio SSH protocol code as LGPL so that it may be used by the broader Python community. I am willing to donate it fully to the Python Software Foundation itself so they may incorporate it into the standard library if wanted. See client.py for a simple example of how dead simple my asyncio SSH library is to use.

INSTRUCTIONS

To run, execute the following:

> python3 node.py

To get some help, try:

> python3 node.py --help

Then simply point your web browser to localhost:4251, or use the mcc command line client, or ssh to localhost:4250. I recommend using the MORPHiS firefox plugin that will be listed on the front page when you hit localhost:4251. (ANY DEVS THAT CAN HELP WITH THIS DEAD SIMPLE PLUGIN WILL BE SUPER APPRECIATED!)
