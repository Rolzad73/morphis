Version: 0.8.0 - Developer Preview Release

License: GPL v2 for everything except for some files LGPL, and some public domain. See the LICENSE file for complete details.

I have done this, released the asyncio SSH protocol code as LGPL so that it may be used by the broader Python community. I am willing to donate it fully to the Python Software Foundation itself so they may incorporate it into the standard library if wanted. See client.py for a simple example of how dead simple my asyncio SSH library is to use.

NOTE

This is a developer preview release. As such, it may not work well in your exact setup. It is fully functional however. Any problems that you have, suggestions, Etc., I am happy hear.

INSTRUCTIONS

Dependencies:
    Python >= 2.4.1, PyCrypto (2.6 tested), sqlalchemy (0.9.8 tested).

To run, execute the following:

> ./run.sh

Or:

> python3 node.py

To get some help, try:

> python3 node.py --help

WARNING: If you are running on a shared host, you really should run with the shell disabled:

> python3 node.py --disableshell

NOTE: That will prevent the mcc.py commandline tool from working as well. I will fix that later by having it ssh key based authentication for shell connections.

Then simply point your web browser to localhost:4251, or use the mcc command line client, or ssh to localhost:4250. I recommend using the MORPHiS firefox plugin that will be listed on the front page when you hit localhost:4251. (ANY DEVS THAT CAN HELP WITH THIS DEAD SIMPLE PLUGIN WILL BE SUPER APPRECIATED!)
