Running MORPHiS is dead simple, and will be even simplier when I launch the official release.

There are only two dependencies other than Python 3.

pycrypto >= 2.6 (tested with 2.6)
SQLAlchemy >= 0.9.8 (tested with 0.9.8)

and of course:

Python >= 3.4.1 (tested with 3.4.1 :)

NOTE: SqlAlchemy 0.9.8 does have a bug and thus you should use the latest, 1.0.8 if you can.

No installation of MORPHiS is neccesary.

Although there is a Makefile which will compile some of the python files with Cython to give a big speed boost, it is not at all neccesary and already very fast without compliation. So just ignore the Makefile/Cython unless you are already familiar with Cython. You can try typing make, if it works, it works, if not, don't worry about it.

To run, simply type this:

python3 node.py

The node will listen for user HTTP requests on port 4251. Instruct your browser to visit: http://localhost:4251/ and you will be presented with the root interface of MORPHiS.

The node will listen for other nodes on port 4250 by default. You may choose a different port than 4250 for your own node to listen on by specifying the bind parameter:

python3 node.py --bind :<PORT>

You do not need to open a firewall port. MORPHiS is designed to not care about firewalls much. If you can, do open the node (4250) port on your firewall, as it may slightly increase your performance, as well as help the network more.

If you are going to do an upload, it is best to wait about 10 minutes (only maters for the very first run of a node). This is because otherwise your node won't neccesarily stick the data into optimal nodes and thus making requests for that data harder. You can just upload the data again later to reinforce it. MORPHiS keys are deterministic based upon the data, so a file will always have the same key no mater who or when uploaded it.

That is it. Enjoy!
